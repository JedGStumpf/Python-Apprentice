"""
Final Project for St. James Trimester 2.
Code a function that takes in a string and returns that string scrambled.
Call the function with 3 different words.

Bonus...   Loop the function call to count how many times it has to run until the 
    function randomly returns the same word in the same order!!!!
    
Have Fun!
